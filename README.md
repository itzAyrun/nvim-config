# Neovim Configuration for Python and Go

This is my personal [Lua](https://www.lua.org) based configuration for Neovim that I use for programming in [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Go](https://go.dev). This setup is the product of continous enhancements based in what I have found in configurations shared by other users. This is an ongoing project that may evolve with time as I come across with new plugins, refine mappings or refactor configuration files.

Feel free to fork this repository and adapt it to your own needs.
